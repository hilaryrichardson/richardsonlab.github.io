# Kids Corner!
Our lab is part of the [Wee Science](https://www.weescience.ppls.ed.ac.uk/) group at the University of Edinburgh, which uses a variety of methods to better understand how babies and children learn to think and talk.

We recently concluded recruitment of junior brain scientists who are **five years old** to participate in our MRI study. Thank you to all of the families who contributed their time and to those who reached out to learn more about our research!

##### Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort
Our lab also contributes to the [Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort study](http://www.tebc.ed.ac.uk/). 
This study will be recruiting new participants through November 2021. If you are expecting a baby, or have given birth in the last few days or weeks, check if you are [eligible to participate](http://www.tebc.ed.ac.uk/for-families/join-the-study/eligibility/) - we'd love to have you!
