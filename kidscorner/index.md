# Kids Corner!
Our lab is part of the [Wee Science](https://www.weescience.ppls.ed.ac.uk/) group at the University of Edinburgh, which uses a variety of methods to better understand how babies and children learn to think and talk.

##### Want to know what your child's brain looks like? So do we!
We are currently looking for junior brain scientists who are **five years old** to participate in our MRI study. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a safe and non-invasive way to study brain activity and anatomy. Children will play fun games with researchers and inside our MRI scanner. As a thank you for participating, children will receive an Amazon gift card, a small prize, and even a picture of their brain! We also provide free parking and snacks for our families. This study takes place at the [Edinburgh Imaging Facility at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/edinburgh-imaging/research/facilities-and-equipment/edinburgh-imaging-facilities/edinburgh-imaging-facility-rie). For more information, please email Hilary at weebrains@ed.ac.uk!

##### Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort
Our lab also contributes to the [Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort study](http://www.tebc.ed.ac.uk/). 
This study has resumed in-person data collection. If you are expecting a baby, or have given birth in the last few days or weeks, check if you are [eligible to participate](http://www.tebc.ed.ac.uk/for-families/join-the-study/eligibility/) - we'd love to have you!
